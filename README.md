# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: audio-haven 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/47900041-e298-4501-a04a-d63a51a86487/improve

**Description**: Create me a React Native mobile app for Android and iOS and Web for playing Podcasts. There should be a trending section where popular podcasts being listened to are displayed. A top rated section where the most favorited podcasts are displayed. A search bar at the top of the page along with the usual buttons for exploring and discovering podcasts with hash tags for different topics. Each podcast should be a box with a small avatar, title, username (author), hash tags, a "listen to podcast" and "favorite podcast", a small flag button to "flag" a podcast. When you click "listen to podcast" it should spring up at the bottom of the page, a podcast player with progress bar, avatar, title, username, next/previous buttons, play button (that turns to pause after click), favorite button, share button, and a setting button. Should be minimal, intuitive, and responsive to different screen sizes.
